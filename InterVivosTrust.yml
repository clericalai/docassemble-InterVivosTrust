  ![PER STIRPES CHART](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Comparison_of_per_stirpes_and_per_capita_inheritance.PNG)
  Per stripes distribution can result in members of the same generation inheriting different amounts, because distribution is determined by family branch, not just individual. The chart is an example showing differences between per stirpes inheritance and per capita by generation inheritance. On the left, each branch receives one third of the estate. On the right, A's only surviving descendant, C, receives one third of the estate. The remaining two thirds are divided among the descendants in the next generation.
