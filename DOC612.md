### W I T N E S S E T H :###

WHEREAS, the Settlor wishes to establish a revocable trust by transferring the assets described on the attached **Schedule A** to the Trustee to hold and administer upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Trust Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Settlor contemplates that Settlor may, by inter vivos document, transfer other assets and property to the Trustee, to be added to the trust estate; and

WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to hold and administer such property as Trustee may receive upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Trust Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the Settlor and the Trustee do hereby agree as follows:

### ARTICLE I. Trust Estate###

Settlor has conveyed, transferred, and assigned and does by these presents convey, transfer, and assign unto the Trustee the assets and properties described on **Schedule A** attached hereto and made a part hereof.  Such assets and properties shall be held, administered, and distributed as a revocable, amendable trust, subject to the provisions hereof, for the uses and purposes hereinafter set out.  Settlor or any other person or persons may by a written document, or by a Will, or by naming the Trustee as beneficiary of life insurance or employee benefit plan proceeds, deliver to the Trustee at any time and from time to time additional assets and properties acceptable to the Trustee, which additional assets and properties shall be held, administered, and distributed pursuant to this Trust Agreement.  The Settlor shall have the right to use and occupy residential property owned by the Trust created hereunder as the Settlor&#39;s principal residence rent free and without charge until the death of the Settlor or until this Trust Agreement is revoked or terminated, whichever occurs first.  Further, any such property (or any interest therein) shall be acquired by an instrument of title that describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and the interest acquired, and the instrument shall be recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.  This section shall be construed in accordance with the Settlor&#39;s intentions to qualify such property as the Settlor&#39;s residential homestead for ad valorem tax purposes by causing the Trust which owns such property to be a &quot;qualifying trust&quot; as defined and described in Section 11.13(j) of the Texas Tax Code.  This intention shall be overriding and shall control if it conflicts with the literal language of this section.

All of the provisions of this Article VII are applicable to all trusts and shares created by this Trust Agreement.

A. Succession of Trustees.  The initial Trustee of the Trust created by this Trust Agreement shall be ${ Trustee.name }.  If ${ Trustee.name } should fail or cease to serve as Trustee for any reason, then ${ Successor_Trustee.name } shall serve as successor Trustee.  If both ${ Trustee.name } and ${ Successor_Trustee.name } should fail or cease to serve as Trustee for any reason, then a successor Trustee shall be appointed in the manner and with the qualifications pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement set forth in the paragraph below entitled &quot;APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEES&quot;.

B. Removal of Trustees.  The Settlor (including the legal guardian or legal representative of Settlor in the case that Settlor is under legal disability)
% if trust_has_age_conditions is true:
, or after the death of Settlor, a majority of the trust beneficiaries (including a beneficiary&#39;s natural or legal guardian or legal representative in the case that a beneficiary is under legal disability) who might then be entitled to receive a distribution from the trust estate,
% endif
shall have the power to remove any trustee and any successor trustees then serving and to appoint a successor trustee.  If a trustee is removed, such trustee must be replaced by another trustee in the manner and with the qualifications pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement set forth in the paragraph below entitled &quot;APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEES&quot;.  Such removal shall be by a written document, duly executed and acknowledged by the removing parties and by the successor trustee, and shall be filed in the Real Property Records of the County in which the Trust's real property is situated.  The successor trustee shall promptly deliver a copy of such recorded document to the trustee being removed and then serving and the delivery of such recorded document shall immediately deprive the removed trustee of all powers as trustee hereunder.  No purchaser from or other person dealing with any trustee is obligated to examine the County records and any such person shall be protected in all transactions with any trustee, whether or not any such replacement has taken place.

C. Resignation of Trustees.  Any Trustee is authorized to resign by filing a written document, duly executed and acknowledged by the resigning trustee, of record in the Real Property Records of the County in which the Trust's real property is situated, which filing shall immediately deprive the Trustee of all powers as Trustee hereunder; provided, nevertheless, that at least thirty (30) days prior to filing such document, the resigning Trustee shall give written notice thereof to the Settlor (including the legal guardian or legal representative of Settlor, in the case that the Settlor is under legal disability)
% if trust_has_age_conditions is true:

% endif
.

D. Appointment of Successor Trustees.  If any trustee appointed or serving pursuant to this Trust Agreement should fail or cease to serve as trustee for any reason and no trustee has been named in this document to serve as successor, or if all successor trustees named herein have failed or ceased to serve for any reason, then the Settlor (including the legal guardian or legal representative of a Settlor in the case that Settlor is under legal disability)
% if trust_has_age_conditions is true:
, or after the death of Settlor, a majority of the trust beneficiaries (including a beneficiary&#39;s natural or legal guardian or legal representative in the case of a beneficiary under a legal disability) who might then be entitled to receive a distribution from the trust estate,
% endif
shall have the power to appoint, as successor trustee, any national or state bank or trust company possessing trust powers and having a capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least Twenty Million Dollars, or any individual regardless of domicile.  Such appointment shall be made by a written document, duly executed and acknowledged by the appointing parties and by the successor trustee being appointed, and shall be filed for record in the Real Property Records of the County in which the Trust's real property is situated.  If a successor trustee is not appointed as hereinabove provided, then a court of competent jurisdiction shall be requested to appoint a successor trustee with the qualifications set forth above, and the costs associated with such a court proceeding shall be paid from the trust or trusts for which the successor trustee is appointed.

E. Relinquishment of Powers.  Any trustee may release or relinquish any one or more of any powers, rights or privileges which, in the trustee&#39;s judgment, unless released or relinquished, might result in adverse consequences to the trust estate or any beneficiary because of changes in law or interpretation of the law.  Any such release or relinquishment shall be made by a written document, duly executed and acknowledged by said trustee, and shall be filed for record in the Real Property Records of the County in which the Trust's real property is situated.  After any power has been so released or relinquished, it shall never again be exercised by such trustee.

F. Compensation and Bond.  Any trustee serving hereunder shall be reimbursed for any and all expenses incurred while acting as trustee of the Trust created pursuant to the provisions hereof, and in addition any corporate trustee shall receive fair and reasonable compensation for services as trustee in accordance with the corporate trustee&#39;s regular fee schedules as published from time to time.  No trustee serving hereunder shall be required to furnish bond or any other security, and all rights, powers, authorities, privileges and discretions herein conferred upon any trustee authorized to serve hereunder shall be exercised without the supervision of any court, it being intended that so far as can be legally provided the trustee serving shall be completely free of all court supervision of any kind, including the requirements of any accounting; provided, however, that the then serving trustee shall furnish an accounting to any beneficiary or guardian of any beneficiary upon reasonable demand made therefor.

G. Powers and Duties of Successor Trustees.  On the appointment and qualification of any successor trustee, the same duties shall devolve on and the same rights, powers, authorities, privileges, and discretions shall inure to such successor trustee as to the Trustee originally designated hereunder.  All rights, powers, authorities, privileges and discretions shall be exercised without the supervision of any court.  No successor trustee shall have any duty, responsibility, obligation or liability whatsoever for the acts, defaults or omissions of any predecessor trustee.  Any successor trustee named herein shall be responsible only for the assets delivered by the preceding trustee, or his or her legal representative, and may accept as correct the statements of such predecessor, or his or her legal representative, that these constitute all of the assets of the trust estate, without any duty to inquire into the administration or accounting by the preceding trustee.  No successor trustee shall be held responsible for and by reason of any act or omission of a predecessor in trust.

H. Reorganization of any Corporate Trustee.  Any corporation or national or state banking association that shall succeed to all or the greater part of the assets of any corporate trustee serving hereunder by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, shall succeed to all the rights, duties, and functions of such corporate trustee as trustee under all trusts governed by this Trust Agreement for which the corporate trustee is then serving or may serve as trustee.

### ARTICLE VIII. General Provisions Relating to the Trust###

A. Situs of Trust.  The trusts created herein shall be deemed Texas trusts and shall, in all respects, be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.  However, if the Trustee, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, determines that a change of situs would be beneficial to the purposes of any separate trust established by this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall have the discretion and authority to change the situs of any such trust to another state.  Formal notice of any change of situs may be given by filing of record a written declaration in the Real Property Records of the County in which the Trust's real property is situated, or if no real property is owned by the Trust, then in the Real Property Records of Bexar County, Texas.  If the situs of any such trust is changed to another state, then the trust shall, in all respects, be governed by the laws of the state which is the new situs.  No such change of situs shall be authorized herein, however, which would result in a termination of the trust for federal tax purposes.

B. Small Trust Provision.  Any provision of this Trust Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any trustee, other than a beneficiary hereof, shall have the discretionary power to terminate any separate trust created by this Trust Agreement whenever the continued management thereof is no longer economical because of the small size of such trust, taking into consideration financial or other special advantages to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of continuing the trust estate.  Upon the termination of any trust estate, the then remaining corpus and undistributed income shall be distributed outright and free of trust to the Settlor, if living; otherwise to the beneficiaries thereof, or to a custodian named for a beneficiary under a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, or to the beneficiaries&#39; legal representatives in proportion to their respective presumptive interests in the trust or share at the time of such termination.  Upon such distribution and delivery, the said trust or share shall terminate and the Trustee then serving shall not be liable or responsible to any person or persons whomsoever for so acting.  The Trustee then serving shall not be liable for failing or refusing at any time to terminate the trust or a share thereof as authorized by this paragraph.

C. Merger of Trusts.  If any time the Trustee of any trust created pursuant to this Trust Agreement shall also be acting as Trustee of any other trust created hereby, or by a Will for the benefit of the same beneficiary or beneficiaries upon substantially the same terms and conditions, the then serving Trustee is authorized and empowered, if in such Trustee&#39;s discretion such action is in the best interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust created hereunder, to transfer and merge all of the assets then held under such trust created pursuant to this Trust Agreement to and with such other trust and thereupon and thereby to terminate the trust created hereby.  Such Trustee is further authorized to accept the assets of the other trust which may be transferred to such trustee of the trust created hereunder and to administer and distribute such assets and properties so transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Trust Agreement.  If the component trusts differ as to contingent beneficiaries and the contingency occurs, the funds may be distributed in such shares as the trustee, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, shall deem necessary to create a fair ratio between the various sets of remaindermen.  If any trust created in this Trust Agreement is merged with any trust created under any other document, such merged trust shall not continue beyond the date on which the earliest maximum term of the trusts so merged would, without regard to such merger, have been required to expire.  Settlor further directs that, as to any property belonging to any trust estate at any time (including a merged trust) as to which under the laws of any state applicable to said property that trust is required to be terminated at any time prior to its normal termination date, the trust as to that particular property shall terminate at the time required by the laws of said state.

D. Perpetuities Provision.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement to the contrary, any trust herein created, if it has not previously terminated, shall terminate twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last to survive of the Settlor and all the lineal descendants of the Settlor living on the date of this Trust Agreement.  Upon such termination, the remaining assets and property of the trust shall be delivered and distributed, outright and free of trust, to the person or persons to whom the income of the particular trust may be distributed at that time.  If the income of a particular trust may be distributed to more than one person at that time, the then serving Trustee shall divide the assets and properties between such persons in such proportions between them as said Trustee shall determine, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, to best carry out the Settlor&#39;s intentions as expressed in this document.

E. Spendthrift Provision.  No beneficiary shall have the right or power to anticipate, by assignment or otherwise, any income or corpus given to such beneficiary or any portion thereof; nor, in advance of actually receiving the same, shall any beneficiary have the right or power to sell, transfer, encumber or in anywise charge same; nor shall such income or corpus, or any portion of same, be subject to any divorce, execution, garnishment, attachment, insolvency, bankruptcy or other legal proceeding of any character, or legal sequestration, levy or sale or in any event or manner be applicable or subject, voluntarily or involuntarily, to the payment of such beneficiary&#39;s debts or other obligations.

### ARTICLE IX. Powers of the Trustee###

The Trustee shall have and may exercise the following rights, powers and privileges with respect to each trust created by this instrument, unless specifically limited by other provisions of this instrument:

A. Distributions.  The Trustee shall have full power and authority to make all partitions, divisions and distributions contemplated by any of the provisions of this instrument.  Any partitions, divisions or distributions may be made by allocating assets and property proportionately in kind or by allocating undivided interests therein in kind.  Any partition, division, or distribution made by the Trustee in good faith shall be binding and conclusive on all interested parties.  In the event that a beneficiary shall, in the opinion of the Trustee, be incapacitated by reason of age, illness, or any other cause at the time of a particular distribution, the Trustee may apply the distribution for the benefit of such beneficiary in any manner that the Trustee may deem advisable, whether by payment of such beneficiary&#39;s expenses or to any such beneficiary, the legal or natural guardian, the person having custody of such beneficiary or any other person deemed suitable by the Trustee.  Should any property be distributable hereunder to a minor person, the Trustee may make the distribution to a custodian for such person under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act of Texas or any other state.

B. Conservation of Trust Properties.  The Trustee may hold, manage and conserve any and all properties transferred to the Trust and may take any action that the Trustee may deem necessary or appropriate, including the exercise of all rights and powers that a prudent owner would exercise in managing and conserving properties of a like kind.

C. Investment in Securities.  The Trustee may buy, sell or trade any security of any nature (including stocks, stock rights, warrants, bonds, debentures, notes, certificates of interest, certificates of indebtedness and options) or any other things of value issued by any person, firm, association, trust, corporation or body politic whatsoever.

D. Securities and Margin Accounts.  The Trustee may buy, sell and trade in securities of any nature, including covered and uncovered options on margin and, for such purposes, may maintain and operate margin accounts with brokers and may pledge any securities with brokers as security for loans and advances made to the Trustee.

E. Investment in Real Estate and Personal Property.  The Trustee may, at such cost and upon such terms as the Trustee may deem advisable, purchase or otherwise acquire real estate and personal property of any kind and hold, manage and conserve the same in whatever manner the Trustee may deem best; lease such property under a lease or leases to commence at once or in the future and for any period of time, even though such period may extend beyond the duration of the Trust; renew and extend leases; partition, exchange, release, convey or assign any right, title or interest of the Trust in any real estate or personal property owned by the Trust; plat real estate and lay out and dedicate streets, alleys and ways; and improve and erect buildings on any real property (in addition to or substitution for buildings at any time existing thereon).

F. Investment in Oil, Gas and Other Mineral Interests.  The Trustee may purchase or otherwise acquire oil, gas and other mineral interests, leases, royalties, overriding royalties, production payments, oil payments, gas payments, net profit overriding royalties, and net profit interests; grant, make and release oil, gas and other mineral leases, subleases and farmouts; enter into development and drilling contracts, operating contracts and utilization agreements; make arrangements for present or future pooling of any interest in oil, gas or other mineral properties and for secondary recovery projects, and exercise with respect to any and all oil, gas and other mineral properties all rights and powers that a prudent owner would have with respect to properties of a like kind.

G. Investment in Undivided Interests.  The Trustee may, for any trusts created under this instrument, jointly hold, manage and invest in one or more assets, properties or consolidated funds, in whole or in part, as the Trustee may determine.  As to each asset, property or consolidated fund, division into the appropriate shares need be made only on the Trustee&#39;s books of account, in which each trust shall be allotted its proportionate part of the principal and income of the asset, property or fund and charged with its proportionate part of the expenses thereof.  No such holding shall, however, defer the vesting in possession of any estate created by this instrument.

H. Investment in Partnerships.  The Trustee may purchase or otherwise acquire an interest in any partnership conducting a lawful business, transfer trust property to any partnership which will conduct or is conducting any lawful business, or become either a general or limited partner of any such partnership.

I. Power to Organize or Continue Business.  The Trustee may continue any business (whether a proprietorship, corporation, partnership, limited partnership or other business entity) which the Trust may own or in which it may be financially interested for such time as the Trustee may deem to be in the best interests of the Trust; employ in the conduct of any such business such capital out of trust as the Trustee may deem proper; borrow money for use in any such business alone or with other persons financially interested in such business, and secure loans by a mortgage, pledge or any other manner of encumbrance of not only the Trust&#39;s property and interest in such business but also such portion of the Trust outside of such business as the Trustee may deem proper; organize, either alone or jointly with others, new corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships or other business entities and convey to it or them trust property or any part thereof; and generally exercise with respect to the continuance, management, sale or liquidation of any business which the Trust may own or in which it may be financially interested, or of any new business or business interest, all the rights and powers which a prudent owner of any such business would have.

J. Selection and Retention of Investments.  Any property acquired by the Trustee and at any time constituting any part of the Trust shall be deemed a proper investment, and the Trustee shall be under no obligation to dispose of or convert such property.  Investments need not be diversified, may be of a wasting nature, and may be made or retained with a view to possible increase in value.  The Trustee may invest all funds available for investment at any time that the Trustee may deem advisable in such investments as the Trustee may be permitted to make pursuant to the terms hereof.  The Trustee, unless otherwise herein specifically prohibited, shall have as wide a latitude in the selection, retention and making of investments as an individual would have in retaining or investing his own funds and shall not be limited to nor bound or governed by any statute or regulation respecting investments.

K. Holding Title to Investments.  The Trustee may hold title to investments in the name of the Trustee or a nominee.  If the Trust owns assets located in a jurisdiction in which the Trustee cannot be authorized to act, then the Trustee may appoint any national bank authorized to act in such jurisdiction as Trustee of such assets and confer on such Trustee any power as may be necessary in the premises, but, in any event, such Trustee shall account for all net income and/or net proceeds from the sale of such assets to the Trustee acting hereunder.

L. General Powers.  The Trustee may sell, exchange, alter, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of trust property; borrow any sum believed by the Trustee to be necessary or desirable for protecting the Trust or any part thereof, making any income or corpus payment or distribution, or for any other purpose which in the Trustee&#39;s opinion may be appropriate; pay all reasonable expenses; execute obligations, negotiable and nonnegotiable; join in, by deposit, pledge, or otherwise, any plan of reorganization or readjustment of any investments of the Trust, and vest in a protective committee or other legal entity such power as in the Trustee&#39;s opinion may be desirable; and sell for cash and/or credit all or any part of the trust property.

M. Power to Make Loans.  The Trustee may make loans, secured or unsecured, in such amounts, upon such terms, at such reasonable rates of interest, and to such persons, firms or corporations as the Trustee may deem proper and appropriate; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be empowered to make any loan to any person or corporation then serving as Trustee hereunder.

N. Power to Vote Stock.  The Trustee may vote shares of stock in person or by proxy, with or without power of substitution; exercise and perform any and all rights, privileges and powers inuring to the holder of any stock or security comprising at any time a part of the Trust, and exercise by agent or attorney-in-fact any right appurtenant to any property or matter in which the Trust may be interested.

O. Protection of the Trust Estate.  The Trustee may protect, perfect and defend the title to any trust property; sue and be sued; enforce any bonds, mortgages or other obligations or liens owned by the Trust; compromise, arbitrate, or otherwise adjust claims in favor of or against the Trust; waive or release rights of any kind; and abandon any property considered by the Trustee to be worthless.

P. Notes, Mortgages, and Foreclosures.  The Trustee may, at any time, reduce the rate of interest payable on any bond, note, or other security owned by the Trust; continue mortgages upon and after maturity, with or without renewal, or extend the same upon such terms as seem advisable to the Trustee without reference to the value of the security at the time of such continuance; modify or release any guaranty or mortgage; as an incident to collection of any bond or note, foreclose and bid in the property at foreclosure sale, acquire the property by deed from the mortgagor or obligor without foreclosure and retain the property so bid in or taken over without foreclosure.

Q. Insurance.  The Trustee may carry such insurance coverage (in stock companies or in mutual companies), including public liability, property damage and life insurance, for such hazards and in such amounts as the Trustee may deem advisable.  With respect to life insurance, the Trustee may acquire life insurance on the life of any beneficiary or on the life of any person in whom a beneficiary has an insurable interest from any company in such amount and type as the Trustee may deem advisable, pay all premiums from either income or principal, and designate as beneficiary the Trustee of the Trust.  With respect to all insurance policies held in the trust estate, unless the Trustee shall arrange for the automatic application of dividends in reduction of premium payments, dividends shall be treated as a return of corpus and applied to the payment of such premiums.

R. Employ and Compensate Agents and Representatives.  The Trustee may employ, appoint, remove and compensate, out of income or corpus or in such proportion between income and corpus as the Trustee may deem proper, agents or other representatives, including accountants, brokers, attorneys-at-law, attorneys-in-fact, investment counsel, investment brokers, realtors, rental agents, geologists, engineers, and other assistants and advisers, as are deemed by the Trustee to be helpful in the proper administration of the Trust, without liability for any neglect, omission, misconduct, or default of such agent or representative, provided such agent or representative was selected and retained by the Trustee with due care.

S. Establish and Maintain Reserves.  Out of rents, profits, or other income received, the Trustee may set up reserves for taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, repairs, improvements, depletion, depreciation, obsolescence and general maintenance of buildings or other property.

T. Power to Determine Income and Corpus.  Stock dividends and capital gains shall be treated as corpus.  Except as herein otherwise specifically provided, the Trustee shall determine in accordance with general principles of federal tax law the manner in which expenses are to be borne and receipts credited between corpus and income and what shall constitute income, net income and corpus.  In determining such matters, the Trustee may give consideration to, but shall not be bound by, the provisions of the Texas Trust Code.

U. Liability of Third Party.  No purchaser at any sale made by the Trustee or person dealing with the Trustee is obliged to see to the application of any money or property paid or delivered to the Trustee or to inquire into the expediency or propriety of, or the authority of the Trustee to enter into and consummate, any transaction.

V. Documents.  The Trustee may execute and deliver any deeds, conveyances, assignments, leases, contracts, stock or security transfer powers, or any other written instrument of any character appropriate to any of the powers or duties herein conferred upon the Trustee.

W. Transactions with Beneficiaries and Fiduciaries.  The Trustee is authorized to enter into any transaction permitted by this instrument, even though the other party to that transaction is a beneficiary; the estate of a beneficiary; a trust created by or for the benefit of a beneficiary, whether living or deceased; the estate of Settlor; a personal representative of any estate, including that of Settlor; or a Trustee of any trust, including the Trustee under this instrument acting individually; except to the extent that the Texas Trust Code, as amended, or any successor statute may expressly prohibit Settlor from authorizing any corporate Trustee serving hereunder from engaging in any such transaction.  The Trustee is authorized, but not directed, to lend trust funds to the personal representatives of the Settlor&#39;s estate upon such security and for such time and at such rate of interest as the Trustee, in its sole discretion, deems proper, and to purchase any assets from the personal representatives of the Settlor&#39;s estate for such sums and on such terms as the Trustee may deem appropriate or proper; provided, however, that the Trustee shall be required to act in all such matters on the same basis as it would in dealing at arm&#39;s length with an unrelated third party.

X. Reserve for Taxes and Obligations.  Upon the date of Settlor&#39;s death, the Trustee shall be authorized to withhold from distribution of principal in accordance with this instrument an amount of property sufficient, in Trustee's judgment, to cover any liability that may be imposed upon the Trustee or the trust estate for estate, inheritance or other taxes attributable to the estate of Settlor, or to meet any obligations (including all taxes) of such Settlor or expenses with respect to the administration of his estate, and to pay such liabilities, obligations and expenses out of the Trust created hereunder.  Upon the Trustee being satisfied that the Trustee and the trust estate no longer has any liability with respect to such taxes and that the Trustee and the trust estate need not pay such liabilities, obligations and expenses, the balance of such withheld property shall be distributed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Trust Agreement.  Neither the trust estate nor any trust beneficiary shall be entitled to reimbursement from the estate of such Settlor, or his heirs or devisees, on account of any payment made pursuant to this paragraph.

Y. Powers Cumulative.  Except as herein otherwise provided, the powers conferred upon the Trustee shall not be construed as in limitation of any authority conferred by law, including but not limited to the Texas Trust Code (including any amendments thereto) and its successor statute or statutes, but as in addition thereto.

### ARTICLE X. Provisions Relating to Life Insurance Policies###

A. Rights Reserved in Policies and Benefit Plans.  The Settlor reserves to himself during his lifetime, and may receive or exercise without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any beneficiary hereunder, all benefits, payments, dividends, surrender values, options, rights, powers and privileges with respect to the policies listed in the attached **Schedule A**, and any other policies or any benefit plans which may be made payable to the Trustee hereunder, including, but not limited to, the following:

1. The power, as provided in Article I above, to add the proceeds of any other policies of insurance and any benefit plans to the operation of the Trust by making such policies and benefit plans payable to the Trustee;

2. The right to receive or apply dividends or distributive shares of surplus, disability benefits, surrender values or the proceeds of matured endowments;

3. The power to obtain and receive from the respective insurance companies such advances or loans on account of policies as may be available;

4. The power to exercise any option, right or privilege granted in any policy or benefit plan;

5. The power to borrow on, sell, assign or pledge any policy or rights under any benefit plan;

6. The power to change the beneficiary of any policy or benefit plan;

7. The power to withdraw a policy or benefit plan from the operation of this Trust in order to exercise a reserved power or for any other purpose;

8. The power to change the beneficiaries under this Trust Agreement, their respective shares and plans of distribution; and

9. The power to convert any policy of insurance into another form or forms of insurance.

It is the intent of the parties hereto that as to the life insurance policies listed on the attached **Schedule A**, the Trustee shall receive only the proceeds payable at the death of the insured Settlor subject to all loans and charges against such proceeds as may have accrued during such Settlor&#39;s lifetime, and the Settlor shall, during his lifetime, retain all other contractual benefits, powers and options under such policies and benefit plan.

B. Duty Regarding Policies and Premium Payments.

1. Settlor&#39;s Duties.  It is the Settlor&#39;s intention to pay all premiums, assessments, or other charges necessary to keep all policies owned by them and payable to the Trustee in force, but the Settlor shall be under no duty to do so and shall sustain no liability to anyone if Settlor should permit any policies within operation of the Trust to lapse for non-payment of premiums, assessments, or other charges, or otherwise permit the policies, or any of them, to become uncollectible.

2. Trustee&#39;s Duties.  The Trustee shall be under no obligation, during the lifetime of the Settlor, to pay any premiums, assessments, or other charges necessary to keep the policies in force, nor shall the Trustee be under any obligation to ascertain whether the same have been paid, or to notify any person of the non-payment of premiums.  The Trustee shall keep safely all policies deposited with the Trustee, and shall, at the request of the Settlor, execute such releases and other documents as shall be required to permit the Settlor to exercise any options, privileges, or powers reserved to the Settlor hereunder.

C. Trustee&#39;s Duties Upon Insured Settlor&#39;s Death.  As soon as practicable after the death of an insured Settlor, the Trustee shall make such proofs of death as shall be required under any policies of insurance then within the operation of this Trust Agreement and payable to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall receive such sums of money as shall be due to the Trustee under the terms of such policies of life insurance, including double indemnity benefits, and hold the same, in trust, for the uses and purposes hereinafter set forth.  To facilitate the receipt of such sums of money, the Trustee shall have the power to execute and deliver receipts and other documents, to compromise or adjust disputed claims in such manner as the Trustee, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, may deem just, and to take such steps as the Trustee, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, shall deem necessary and proper for collection thereof; provided that if payment on any policy is contested, the Trustee shall not be obligated to take any action for collection unless and until the Trustee shall have been indemnified to the Trustee&#39;s satisfaction against any loss, liability, or expense, including attorney&#39;s fees; and provided further, that the Trustee may, in the Trustee&#39;s sole discretion, use any funds in the Trustee&#39;s hands, whether corpus or income, to pay the costs and expenses, including attorney&#39;s fees, of bringing action for the collection of the proceeds of any policy hereunder, and the Trustee may be reimbursed for any advances made for such purposes.  Upon payment to the Trustee of the amounts due under the policies of insurance payable hereunder, the insurance companies issuing such policies shall be relieved of all further liability hereunder, and no such insurance company shall be under any responsibility to see to the performance of the Trust created hereby.

To the extent permitted, the Trustee shall have the right to negotiate and receive proceeds from employee benefit plans in any manner the Trustee may deem prudent and consistent with the tax (estate, generation-skipping, income, and other) and other objectives of any trust established hereunder and its beneficiaries; provided, however, if such proceeds would be otherwise exempt from federal estate taxes in whole or in part, the Trustee shall not elect to receive, use or expend such otherwise exempt proceeds in such a manner as will subject them to federal estate taxation in Settlor&#39;s estate without the written consent of the personal representative of Settlor&#39;s estate.
